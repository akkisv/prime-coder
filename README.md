Meaning of Java.

<p>
Java is a general purpose, high level programming language designed to produce programs that will run on any computer system.
<br><br>
Java was developed by <b>Sun Microsystem</b>. A small team of engineers, known as the <b>Green Team</b>, initiated the language in 1991. Java was originally called <b>OAK</b>, and was designed for handheld devices and set-top boxes. Oak was unsuccessful, so in 1995 Sun changed the name to Java and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning <b>World Wide Web</b>.
<br><br>
Later, in 2009, <b>Oracle Corporation</b> acquired Sun Microsystems and took ownership of two key Sun software assets: Java and Solaris.

JavaScript

<p>
<b>JavaScript</b> is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of <b>World Wide Web</b> content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins.
<br><br> 
JavaScript is <b>prototype-based</b> with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include <b>any I/O</b>, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

What is opensource
</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
The term <b>"open source"</b> refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
<br><br>
The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. Today, however, "open source" designates a broader set of valuesâ€”what we call "the open source way." Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.
<br><br>
This is a common misconception about what "open source" implies, and the concept's implications are not only economic.

Open source software programmers can charge money for the open source software they create or to which they contribute. But in some cases, because an <b>open source license</b> might require them to release their source code when they sell software to others, some programmers find that charging users money for software services and support (rather than for the software itself) is more <b>lucrative</b>. This way, their software remains free of charge, and they make money helping others install, use, and troubleshoot it.
